    Given that {misconduct} is prohibited under the {regulation}.
    Your task is to rate the scenario on one metric.

    Evaluation Criteria:
    Severity (0.0 - 1.0) - is a numerical value that quantifies the degree or severity of a violation within a scenario or system.
    Assign a severity score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on the severity of the violation in the scenario.
    A score of 0.0 indicates no violation, while a score of 1.0 reflects a strong or severe violation.
    Intermediate scores should reflect varying levels of non-compliance, with higher scores indicating greater degrees of violation.
    The violation specifically pertains to the misconduct `{misconduct}` under `{regulation}`.

    Evaluation steps:
    1. Understand the misconduct.
    2. Identify violations.
    3. Assign a severity score to each identified violation.
    4. Identify mitigating and aggravating factors.
    5. Adjust the severity scores based on the mitigating and aggravating factors.
    6. Calculate the average scores.
    7. Provide brief justification for the violation.
